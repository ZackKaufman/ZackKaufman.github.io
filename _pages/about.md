Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher co-affiliated with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and the Ocean Climate Connections Group at Temple University. I am currently based at Scripps, working with Rebecca Beadling and Matthew Mazloff. My research focuses on high-latitude climate variability, ocean-ice sheet interactions, and data-driven approaches to improving climate model projections. Before my current position, I worked in the Polar Ocean Dynamics Group at Stanford with Earle Wilson. I completed my PhD in Earth & Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz with Nicole Feldl.
