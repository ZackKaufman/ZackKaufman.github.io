    <h2>Historical Southern Ocean Climate Trends</h2>
    <p> 
    While most of Earth's surface has warmed over the satellite era, the Southern Ocean sea surface experienced a prolonged cooling trend. One proposed driver of this anomalous cooling is the increasing flux of freshwater into the Southern Ocean, which restricts the exchange of surface waters with warmer waters at depth. I led a collaboration with the Southern
    Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica initiative (SOFIA, https://sofiamip.github.io/) to quantify the impact of underestimated Antarctic meltwater on Southern Ocean sea-surface temperatures in climate models. I show that this missing meltwater helps explain the modelsâ€™ inability to reproduce observed trends over recent decades.
